- Very compatible with most mods.
- Keep a uniform style across the whole game
- Make changes that you normally cannot make
- Settings can be set quickly and easily in realtime with Configuration Manager

## Features in Detail ##
- Game objects are placed into 6 groups, each group has their own adjustable settings.
- Settings you can change include: 
  - Rim lighting
  - Shadow casting/recieving 
  - Shadow color and width
  - Change shaders to outlined shaders
  - Outline color and width
  - Toon textures
- When an object that falls into one of the groups is loaded, your settings are applied seamlessly.

  These groups are not changeable or customizable.

## Usage ##

Usage is pretty simple. Drop the plugin .dll into your Bepinex/Plugins folder and start your game. If you're using configuration manager, which is how AdvancedMaterialModifier (aka AMM) was designed to be configured, then press F1 and set your settings underneath the AMM drawer there. 

If you are not using ConfigurationManager, then check Bepinex/Config for a new configuration file that can be used to configure AMM. Changes may not apply immediately without a restart if this method is used.

And don't abuse your meidos!
